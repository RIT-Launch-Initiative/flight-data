Note that we most likely did not log data during flight based on the behavior of the other 3 modules.
Some of these graphed flights may be simulations that were ran and logged in the sensor module.
I wrote a script that scans the dumped flash for data and tries to locate flights based on reading values that would be within the expected range.
